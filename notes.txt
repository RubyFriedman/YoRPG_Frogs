So far we believe that we have figured out how inheritance and extensions of classes
SHOULD work, and we were able to make the Character.java file, but when we attempted
to remove the overlapping methods in Protagonist.java and Monster.java, the code broke.
In addition we have been utilizing the colaborative repository quite well.

In class we learned about the protected variables, which solved our problem about why our
inheritance/extensions of classes didn't work. (it has been working since v2)

Additionally, we used the protected variables again to add more extensions to class Monster.java
and Protagonist.java- like Archer.java, Dragon.java, etc. which gave the characters different 
healths/strengths/defense/attacks.

Using the "\nChoose your diffculty: \n" as a reference, we created a similar selection
to choose the class for the protagonist and used if statements to create new instance of
Healer/Knight/Archer to pat.

We also used if statements and Math.random to create new instances of Dragon/Centaur/Zombies
to samug.
