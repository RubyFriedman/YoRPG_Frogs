DISCO:
 * Discovered how to use extends when extending a class with a lot of overlap.
 * Discovered how to create a colaborative repository.
 * Discovered how to use protected instance variables and why they're important for subclasses.
 * Discovered how to use try and catch commands to catch all possible outcomes.
 * Discovered how to effectively use subclasses to simplify and refactor code.
QCC:
 * How do we edit the rarer monsters to be more likely to appear with a higher difficulty?
 * How do we randomize the attack value for each turn rather than for each monster?
 * What other types of visability are there other than public, private and protected?

11/22/21 So far we believe that we have figured out how inheritance and extensions of classes
SHOULD work, and we were able to make the Character.java file, but when we attempted
to remove the overlapping methods in Protagonist.java and Monster.java, the code broke.
In addition we have been utilizing the colaborative repository quite well.

11/23/21 In class we learned about the protected variables, which solved our problem about why our
inheritance/extensions of classes didn't work. (it has been working since v2)

Additionally, we used the protected variables again to add more extensions to class Monster.java
and Protagonist.java- like Archer.java, Dragon.java, etc. which gave the characters different 
healths/strengths/defense/attacks.

Using the "\nChoose your diffculty: \n" as a reference, we created a similar selection
to choose the class for the protagonist and used if statements to create new instance of
Healer/Knight/Archer to pat.

We also used if statements and Math.random to create new instances of Dragon/Centaur/Zombies
to samug.
