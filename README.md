TNPG: Frogs (Ivina Wang, Samantha Hua, Ruby Friedman)

NEW CLASSES

Our three new Protagonist subclasses (Healter, Knight, and Archer) have different strengths and weaknesses that
coorelate to different values of those variables. The user has the option to pick which character they would like
to be. 

Our three new Monster subclasses (Dragon, Centaur, Zombies) vary in difficulty. We have made it so that it is less
likely to encounter a tougher Monster. 


VERSION TO VERSION MODIFICATIONS

v0 to v1 --> implemented specialize() and normalize(). We made Character.java and created subclasses of
Character (Protagonist and Monster)

v1 to v2 --> Utilized protected variables to ensure that they could be accessed by all subclasses of a class

v2 to v3 --> Added subclasses of Protagonist and Monster so that they are more specialized. Modified YoRPG.java
so that the user can choose their Protagonist and the Monsters the user faces are more randomized.


GROWING THIS GAME

- We would like to make the Dragon appearances correspond to difficulty as it is a tougher Monster
- We would like to make more varied Monsters and Protagonist
- We want to make the Monster and Protagonist attack values more random so that each attack will incur different amounts
of damage
